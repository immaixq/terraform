## Terraform
A reference repo populated with Terraform scripts to create, change, and manage infrastructure. Credits to many amazing coders who have made this possible.

### What is Terraform?
Terraform is a tool that helps define and manage infrastructure (such as servers, databases, and networks) using code instead of manual processes. It allows for convenient changes and management of infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.

### Key Benefits of Terraform
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define your infrastructure using declarative configuration files, making it easy to version, reuse, and share.
- **Automation**: Automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure, reducing the risk of human error and saving time.
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Manage resources across various cloud providers (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) using a unified workflow.
- **State Management**: Terraform keeps track of your infrastructure state, allowing you to see changes over time and manage your resources effectively.
- **Collaboration**: Use version control systems (VCS) to collaborate on infrastructure configurations, enabling teams to work together seamlessly.

### Terraform Repo Structure
| Directory Name       | Uses                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `create_n_instances` | Create multiple EC2 instances on AWS, used for distributed training. |
| `gcp_examples`       | Contains examples and reusable modules for managing resources on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). |

### Getting Started with Terraform

**Install Terraform**: Download and install Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

### AWS Examples
- create_n_instances: This example demonstrates how to create multiple EC2 instances on AWS for distributed training purposes. It includes the necessary Terraform configuration files (main.tf, variable.tf, ddp.tfvars) to provision the instances.

### GCP Examples
- Environments: The environments directory contains configurations for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- Modules: The modules directory houses reusable Terraform modules that encapsulate common GCP resources.

### Best Practices

- Version Control: Use Git or other version control systems to manage changes to your Terraform configurations.
- State Management: Consider using remote state storage (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS S3) for better collaboration and state management.
- Modular Design: Break down your Terraform configurations into reusable modules for clarity and maintainability.
