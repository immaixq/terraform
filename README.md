## Terraform
A reference repo populated with terraform scripts to create, change and manage infrastructure. Credits to many amazing coders whom have made this possible.

### What is Terraform?
Terraform is a tool that helps define and manage infrastructure (such as servers, databases, and networks) using code instead of manual processes. 
It allows for convenient changes and management of infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.
